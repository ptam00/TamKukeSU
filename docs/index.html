										<h2 class="major">Renovate.</h2>
										<p>Our campaign will seek to improve student life step by step. We look towards improve the homework situation in the school through a stricter crackdown on disparities and a consolidation of grading systems to create a transparent and more uniform system. We are also looking to renovate restrooms through the installation of new soap dispensers and sinks in addition to Purell stations.</p>

									<div class="content">
										<h2 class="major">Redefine.</h2>
										<p>We look to dramatically amending the Student Union Constitution to better outline the roles that each member has to play in the student community. In addition, we look to redefine the role of the students themselves by establishing the Student Congress.</p>

									<div class="content">
										<h2 class="major">Restore</h2>
										<p>And most importantly, we look to restore confidence that students have with the Student Union and the administration itself. Our plan from the start was to improve transparency in the Student Union. We will promise to update the student body with developments in the SU, no matter how small, and release all pertinent reports to the public including budget reports and communications.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Student Congress</h3>
											<p>This driving force of our campaign will give you, the student, an enhanced role at Stuyvesant. Student elected representatives will be given voting power on things such as the budget and policy changes that affect the entire school. We want to have students play a larger role in managing the school and give them the skills they need to manage in the outside role. We are confident that this will make the Student Union less niche and more inclusive than before. The power to change the school for the better, that is what we are offering you.
											</p>	
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Higher standards of health</h3>
											<p>As we continue our lives in Stuyvesant, our own health will always be held in high regard. We look to further these standards through automation. Contact with objects in the restroom should be minimized. Thatâ€™s why we look towards installing automatic soap dispensers and sinks to maintain overall health. In addition, we look to install hand sanitizer stations outside the restrooms. 
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Expanded opportunities</h3>
											<p>Our campaign will strive to improve alumni outreach to give you, the student, more opportunities to learn and pursue career paths. We also look to push for more class choices for underclassmen. These opportunities, we hope, will enhance student life and give more purpose in learning and growing within the school. 
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Increased presence of the students</h3>
											<p>We look towards having the Student Union play a larger role in the school. We see the SU as a forum of change and as a true union of students who can fight for their own dreams. The amendment of the impeachment policy will be one way students can make more of a significant impact, giving both the student body and the elected representatives to hold officials responsible for their jobs. The amended Student Forums will be all-inclusive, allowing any student to present their views and concerns with the Student Union.
